Build Your Own Blockchain...

### Build your own blockchain competition

Using any tools you want, you will have to build something like this: https://blockchaindemo.io. If you need a little bit of help, you can use [this free UI kit](http://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit/index.html)

Looks difficult? Don't worry, being a developer is all about making small steps towards the end goal. Along the way, you will learn about the Blockchain Data Structure and have another project to put into your portfolio. 

To start you off, I recommend you check out these 2 resources to get the basics of what a blockchain is:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8
2. http://www.darrenbeck.co.uk/blockchain/nodejs/nodejscrypto/

The rest is up to you to research and figure out. Use this as a challenge to learn about blockchain (which will be very important in the future) and also build a portfolio website. I wouldn't be wasting your time if I didn't think this is a great project that would wow your future employers. 


### The Rules Are:

1. You will need to follow the instructions above to build your own blockchain demo website.

2. **You have until April 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

4. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

## Submissions:

Student Submissions will be posted here at the end of the challenge:
